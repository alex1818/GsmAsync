## Description
GsmAsync was implemented to reduce the complexity of communicating with GSM (SIM800, SIM900) modules. The main problem solved here is that user-code has to *wait* for answer arriving from the GSM module. The solution GsmAsync provides is an event-driven communication possibility.

GsmAsync provides two basic features:
* You can add commands to a command-queue, where next commands will be executed automatically uppon success. 
* Your can register callbacks that are called, when the designated answer arrives from the GSM module.

Besides that, GsmAsync also provides **timeout** and **error** handling.

## Working principals

### Command execution
Fortunatelly the communication protocol of the GSM modules is very consistent. You will issue an *AT* command to the module, where it will respond with an answer. And the sentence always finish with *OK* on success.

So you put commands to the command-queue provided by GsmAsync, and the commands will be executed automatically one after an other. The next command will be sent when got *OK* answer for the previous one. If no answer arrives within a time period\*, the command will be resent. The sending will be retried for some times\*\* but finally a *timeout* event will be generated if the GSM module is not responding.

If an *ERROR* result arrives instead of the *OK*, an *error* event will be generated by the GsmAsync library.

### Response subscription

When you request a value from the GSM module the module will likely answer with a strict format. E.g.
```
> AT+CSQ    <--- Signal quality request
+CSQ: 31,0  <--- Response
OK          <--- End of result marker
```

Using this example you can subscribe to an answer *"+CSQ:"* with specifying a custom callback method. Your method will be called, when the response prefix matches with your subscription.
